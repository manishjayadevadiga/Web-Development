<p>Originally I wrote Bhagavad-gétä As It Is in the form in which it is
presented now. When this book was first published, the original manuscript
was, unfortunately, cut short to less than 400 pages, without illustrations and
without explanations for most of the original verses of the Çrémad
Bhagavad-gétä. In all of my other books—Çrémad-Bhägavatam, Çré Éçopaniñad,
etc.—the system is that I give the original verse, its English transliteration,
word-for-word Sanskrit-English equivalents, translations and purports. This
makes the book very authentic and scholarly and makes the meaning
self-evident. I was not very happy, therefore, when I had to minimize my
original manuscript. But later on, when the demand for Bhagavad-gétä As It Is
considerably increased, I was requested by many scholars and devotees to
present the book in its original form. Thus the present attempt is to offer the
original manuscript of this great book of knowledge with full paramparä
explanation in order to establish the Kåñëa consciousness movement more
soundly and progressively.</p><hr/>

Our Kåñëa consciousness movement is genuine, historically authorized,
natural and transcendental due to its being based on Bhagavad-gétä As It Is. <br/>It
is gradually becoming the most popular movement in the entire world,
especially amongst the younger generation. It is becoming more and more
interesting to the older generation also. Older gentlemen are becoming
interested, so much so that the fathers and grandfathers of my disciples are
encouraging us by becoming life members of our great society, the
International Society for Krishna Consciousness. In Los Angeles many fathers
and mothers used to come to see me to express their feelings of gratitude for
my leading the Kåñëa consciousness movement throughout the entire world.
Some of them said that it is greatly fortunate for the Americans that I have
started the Kåñëa consciousness movement in America. But actually the

original father of this movement is Lord Kåñëa Himself, since it was started a
very long time ago but is coming down to human society by disciplic
succession. If I have any credit in this connection, it does not belong to me
personally, but it is due to my eternal spiritual master, His Divine Grace Oà
